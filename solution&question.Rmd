```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


# Solution

### Unable to load devtools package

Execute the following command in Git.

```{r eval=FALSE}
$ git config --global http.sslBackend "openssl"
$ git config --global http.sslCAInfo [path to .pem file]
```

### Quitting from lines 223-235 (Introduciton.Rmd)

Adding `encoding = "UTF-8"` in line 224 can fix it. The line 224 is displayed as

```{r eval=FALSE}
contributors <- read.csv("contributors.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE,encoding = "UTF-8")
```
